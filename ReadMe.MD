## 'AD mk-II' - what is it?

This started out as just an experiment of making the Dijkstra algorithm in [AutoDrive](https://github.com/Stephan-S/AutoDrive) compute faster.

However after some more changes and code-optimizations, it became more than just fixing one method.

This 'AD mk-II' is _NOT_ multiplayer compatible and there may be other introduced flaws, so beware!
